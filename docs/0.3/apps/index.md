webpy applications encompass the urls and handlers that map to them. They fall into several categories:

* [Basic app](/docs/0.3/apps/basic). Define urls and classes to handle them.
* [Auto app](/docs/0.3/apps/auto). Urls are determined automatically based on classes.
* [Subdir app](/docs/0.3/apps/subdir). Run multiple apps on a single domain based on url.
* [Subdomain app](/docs/0.3/apps/subdomain). Run multiple apps based on subdomains.
