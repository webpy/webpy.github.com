# deploying web.py with nginx and mod_wsgi

It is possible to deploy web.py with nginx using a mod_wsgi similar to the module for Apache.

After compiling and installing nginx with mod_wsgi, you can easily get a web.py app up and running with the following config* (edit the paths and settings with your own):

    wsgi_python_executable  /usr/bin/python;

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name www.domain_name.com domain_name.com;
        root /path/to/your/webpy;

        include /etc/nginx/wsgi_vars;
        location / {
            wsgi_pass /path/to/your/webpy/app.py;
         }
    }

*Note: This is a snippet of the relevant information to setup mod_wsgi for your web app and NOT a full config for running nginx.
