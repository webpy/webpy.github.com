## Problem

How do you include an application defined in another file in your application?

## Solution

In `blog.py`:

    import web
    urls = (
        "", "reblog",
        "/(.*)", "blog"
    )

    class reblog:
        def GET(self): raise web.seeother('/')

    class blog:
        def GET(self, path):
            return "blog " + path

    app_blog = web.application(urls, locals())

In your main `app.py`:

    import web
    import blog

    urls = (
        # Note: regex url matching is not supported for sub-app.
        # "/(blog|BLOG)" does not work, you have to define "/blog" and "/BLOG" instead.
        "/blog", blog.app_blog,
        "/(.*)", "index"
    )

    class index:
        def GET(self, path):
            return "hello " + path

    app = web.application(urls, locals())

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run()
